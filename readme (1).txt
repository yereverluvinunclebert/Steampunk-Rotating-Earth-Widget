This Konfabulator/ yahoo widget provides a simple rotating globe that can 
rotate at two speeds. The animation comes from thirty six medium
resolution images, played one after the other, frame by frame giving a
simulation of the rotating
earth.

This is now version 1.0.1 which fixes a bug with regard to running commands 
on Mac OS/X and it also makes sure it does not get lost too when pushed too 
far off-screen.

o The globe.zip contains the widget zipped up (inside is the globe.widget 
file)

o The globe.widget is the unzipped Yahoo Konfabulator widget which you can 
simply download and run.

o The folder structure has been loaded here so you can see what you are 
downloading.
